# Cryptopals Crypto Challenges

My attempt at solving the [Cryptopals
challenges](https://cryptopals.com).  Written as a project for
learning Clojure.

The solution to the challenges are in src/cryptopals/challenges/.

In src/cryptopals you'll find function for block & stream cipher, an
implementation of MT19937 PRNG (plus what's needed to crack it), an
implementation of SHA-1 and some bit manipulation functions.
